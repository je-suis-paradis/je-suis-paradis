    Oh, hi! I'm Pontus, but you can call me p-nut.
                                                    I used to be a copywriter. 
                    For 20 years, I wrote some great stuff, some not as great, 
                                but most of the time, it was good enough. 
            
            Paradiset is my <i>Nom de Guerre</i> -- my alias. 

        During Covid-19, I had to leave my job and play video games, full-time. For
                about a week or two, I was having the best time ever. Then boredom came knocking
            on my door. It told me I needed a hobby. I chose gouache. It was not for me.

    Instead I started a project.  On a sheet of A4, I wrote: 
    
                                            "Paradiset är överallt!"

                            "Paradise(t) is everywhere!" Then it dawned on me, Paradiset can be whatever.
                I'll make up stuff as I move seamlessly between expressions and medium. Be it, writing, graphic design,
                                        or coding.

                            I'm on paradiset.cloud, which is a project I'll take on soon enough. And would love 
                                    for you to tag along.

                    //     p-nut.
