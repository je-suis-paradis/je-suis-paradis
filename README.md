    Oh, hi! I'm Pontus, but call me p-nut.
                                                    I used to be a copywriter. 
                    For 20 years, I wrote some great stuff, some not so great, 
                                but most of the time, it was good enough. 
            
            Paradiset is my Nom de Guerre -- my alias. 

        During Covid-19, I had to leave my job and play video games, full-time. For
                about a week or two, I was having the best time ever. Then, boredom came knocking
            on my door. It told me I needed a hobby. Gouache seemed like a lot of fun. It wasn't.

    Instead, I initiated a project (or embarked on a "journey," as they say.  On a blank sheet of A4, I wrote: 
    
                                            "Paradiset är överallt!"

                            "Paradise(t) is everywhere!" Then it dawned on me, Paradiset can be whatever.
                I'll make up stuff as I move seamlessly between expressions and medium. Be it, writing, graphic design,
                                        or coding. As of August 2025, I'm studying to become a .NET Cloud dev.

                            I'm on paradiset.cloud, which is a project I'll take on soon enough. It would be awesome 
                                    if you were to tag along. Follow me, review, and feedback on my code. I'm only at the beginning, but
                        it's about to be wild ride -- an explosive one. Welcome to Paradiset.
