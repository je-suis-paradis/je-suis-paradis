    Oh, hi! I'm @je-suis-paradis, but you can call me p-nut.,even though I was born Pontus Tenggren.
    Paradiset is an umbrella of sorts, under which I try to realize ideas that
    pop up in my head.
                        My raison d'etre on this here GitHub is primarily to study the vast 
                        landscapes of coding, programming, and the whatnots, 
                        with hopes of picking up some core concepts, and learning
                        a few languages along the way.
                                                        For 20 or so years, I've been a copywriter. 
                                                        Writing is still something I want to pursue,
                                                        but due to severe burnout and/or depression.
                                                        I realized that I had to switch up a thing
                                                        or two. 
                                                                  At the moment, you'll find me at the command line, 
                                                                  trying to build a solid foundation for whatever 
                                                                  it is the future has in store for me.
